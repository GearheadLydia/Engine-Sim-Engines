# Engine Sim Engines by GearheadLydia
Engines for [Engine Sim by Ange Yaghi](https://github.com/ange-yaghi/engine-sim/).

Put these under \assets\engines\ and type the appropriate path into main.mr and everything should work!

Old, broken, etc. versions of the engines are in zz_old_stuff, but will probably be deleted upon subsequent commits.
