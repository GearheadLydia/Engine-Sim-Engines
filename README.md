# Engine Sim Engines by GearheadLydia
Engines for [Engine Sim by Ange Yaghi](https://github.com/ange-yaghi/engine-sim/).

Most car information (weight, drag, tires, gear ratios) is from Automobile Catalog, with some exceptions. Thanks to William Moser for a lot of firing order information. Most of everything else has been gathered from forums, online shopping sites, etc., or simply guessed.

Put these under \assets\engines\ and type the appropriate path into main.mr and everything should work!

Old, broken, etc. versions of the engines are in zz_old_stuff, but will probably be deleted upon subsequent commits.
